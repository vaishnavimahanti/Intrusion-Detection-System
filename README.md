# Intrusion-Detection-System

Introduction:

Supervised learning is an essential technique in machine learning, where labeled data is used to map inputs to outputs by discovering a general rule. This learned rule is then applied to identify unknown outputs using new data, ultimately creating a machine learning model. In this context, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) evaluates the security of network or computer systems by collecting network traffic information and analyzing it to detect and prevent potential attacks.

Problem Statement:

The identification of new or zero-day threats remains a challenge for technology-driven organizations today. Current methods for spotting unseen threats often fall short in dealing with rapidly evolving attack strategies. Thus, an advanced approach is needed to enhance the security measures of IDS by leveraging machine learning.

Proposed Work:

The growing influence and contribution of machine learning in security are undeniable, and it offers many real-world applications. Machine learning is a promising future of computing, and we propose that it can be effectively applied to address the issue of detecting unseen network traffic and zero-day threats.

We developed a supervised machine learning model that classifies unseen network traffic based on knowledge gained from observed data. Specifically, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Random Forest for classification, both of which have shown high accuracy and success rates in identifying new threats.

Machine Learning Methods:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Used for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving as much variability as possible. This enhances the model's performance by eliminating noise and irrelevant features.
Random Forest: A powerful classification method used in our model to make accurate predictions based on network traffic patterns. It combines the outputs of multiple decision trees to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.
